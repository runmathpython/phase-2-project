# phase-2-project
1. Problems with putting each image file in Header and MovieCard have been resolved.

1.1 The image file for the Header can be in the componets folder, and yet, it has to be imported into the Header.

1.2 Each imiage file for the MovieCard has to be in the public folder.

1.2.1 The image location specified in the db.json has to be properly spcified.

1.2.2 The image URL can be used as the image location, also.

2. Inline style doesn't work. So css is used for styling.
